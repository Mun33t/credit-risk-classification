# credit-risk-classification
This repository is dedicated to my  Module 20 Assignment on support vector machines

OVERVIEW: The objective was to predict if a loan is healthy or high risk by using the financial data and logistic regression model.
RESULTS: The model's accuracy was precise overall. In terms of precission, it is not so accurate when it comes to high risk loans (it misses some of them), however it predicts healthy loans well.
SUMMARY: The logistic regression modelworks fine for healthy loans but needs improvement when finding high-risk loans as this could lead to financial risk.
